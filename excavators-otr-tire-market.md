<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Excavators OTR Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Excavators OTR (off-the-road) tire market consists of two main types: radial tire and bias tire. Radial tires are constructed with steel belts running radially across the tire, offering better traction, longer tread life, and improved fuel efficiency. They are ideal for high-speed applications and heavy-load conditions. On the other hand, bias tires use layers of crisscrossed fabric to construct the tire, providing better puncture resistance and durability. They are commonly used in rough terrains and extreme conditions. These tire types cater to different needs and performance requirements within the excavators OTR market.</p></p>
