<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Black Pellets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Torrefaction</li><li>Steam Explosion (SE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Black pellets are a type of bioenergy fuel produced from biomass that undergoes specific processes to enhance its quality and fuel properties. Torrefaction involves heating biomass in the absence of oxygen, resulting in a dry, energy-dense, and water-resistant black pellet. On the other hand, steam explosion (SE) uses high-pressure steam to break down biomass fibers, making it more digestible for organisms that convert it into black pellets. Both torrefaction and steam explosion technologies offer efficient and sustainable solutions for biomass utilization in the energy sector.</p></p>
