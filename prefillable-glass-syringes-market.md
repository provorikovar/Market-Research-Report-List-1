<p><strong>The Prefillable Glass Syringes Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Molecules Injection</li><li>Large Molecules Injection</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Prefillable glass syringes find application in the market for injecting small molecules and large molecules. Small molecules injection involves the administration of drugs with low molecular weight, such as antibiotics or painkillers, directly into the bloodstream. On the other hand, large molecules injection refers to the delivery of biologics, such as vaccines or insulin, which have a higher molecular weight and need to be injected in specific doses. Prefillable glass syringes provide a safe, reliable, and convenient method for administering these medications to patients.</p></p>
