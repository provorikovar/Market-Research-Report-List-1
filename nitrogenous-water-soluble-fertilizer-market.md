<p><strong>The Nitrogenous Water Soluble Fertilizer Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Foliar Application</li><li>Soilless Culture</li><li>Soaking Seeds and Dipping Roots</li><li>Sprinkling Irrigation</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The nitrogenous water-soluble fertilizer market is categorized into various applications. The first is foliar application, which involves spraying the fertilizer on the leaves of plants for absorption. Soilless culture refers to the cultivation of plants without soil, where the fertilizer is mixed with water and applied to the growing medium. Soaking seeds and dipping roots involve immersing seeds or roots in a solution of water and fertilizer before planting. Sprinkling irrigation includes using sprinklers to apply the fertilizer evenly. Finally, other applications may include fertigation, hydroponics, and greenhouse cultivation, among others.</p></p>
