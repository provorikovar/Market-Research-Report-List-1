<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Compression Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dynamic</li><li>Static</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The medical compression pump market is divided into two main types: dynamic and static. Dynamic compression pumps provide intermittent compression to stimulate blood circulation in patients with conditions like lymphedema and venous ulcers. They use air chambers with adjustable pressure settings to deliver controlled compressions. On the other hand, static compression pumps continuously apply compression to affected areas. They typically consist of a bandage or garment that exerts consistent pressure. Both types aim to improve blood flow and alleviate swelling, but dynamic pumps offer adjustable compressions, while static pumps provide a constant level of pressure.</p></p>
