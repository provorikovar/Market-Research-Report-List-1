<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chlorine Stabilizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cyanuric Acid Tablets</li><li>Cyanuric Acid Granular</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The chlorine stabilizer market consists of two types: cyanuric acid tablets and cyanuric acid granular. Cyanuric acid tablets are compacted forms of cyanuric acid that are easy to handle and dissolve slowly in water, releasing the acid gradually to stabilize chlorine levels. On the other hand, cyanuric acid granular is a loose form of the acid that can be quickly dissolved. Both types of stabilizers are used in swimming pools and other water treatment applications to prevent chlorine degradation due to sunlight exposure.</p></p>
