<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Injector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI)</li><li>Port Fuel Injectors (PFI)</li><li>Diesel Fuel Injectors</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The fuel injector market consists of three main types of injectors. Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) injectors are primarily used in gasoline engines, delivering fuel directly into the combustion chamber for improved efficiency and power. Port Fuel Injectors (PFI) are commonly found in older gasoline engines, injecting fuel into the intake ports before entering the combustion chamber. Diesel Fuel Injectors, on the other hand, are specific to diesel engines, delivering fuel into the combustion chamber under high pressure for efficient ignition. Each injector type caters to different engine technologies and requirements.</p></p>
