<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Erbium-Doped Fibers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SM Fiber</li><li>PM Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Erbium-Doped Fiber (EDF) market comprises two major types of fibers - Single-Mode (SM) Fiber and Polarization-Maintaining (PM) Fiber. SM Fiber allows only one mode of light to propagate, enabling high-speed communication over long distances with minimal signal loss. PM Fiber, on the other hand, maintains the polarization state of light, making it suitable for applications that require maintaining the signal's polarization throughout the transmission. Both SM Fiber and PM Fiber are widely used in telecommunications, data centers, and other industries requiring reliable long-distance communication and signal stability.</p></p>
