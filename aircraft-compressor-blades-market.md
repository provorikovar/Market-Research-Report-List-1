<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Compressor Blades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-pressure</li><li>Low-pressure</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The aircraft compressor blades market can generally be categorized into high-pressure and low-pressure types. High-pressure compressor blades are designed to operate in the early stages of the engine, where they compress air at a higher ratio. These blades are typically made of advanced materials due to the harsh working conditions. Conversely, low-pressure compressor blades are used in the later stages of an aircraft engine, where they further compress the air before it enters the combustion chamber. These blades are larger in size and made with different materials than high-pressure blades.</p></p>
