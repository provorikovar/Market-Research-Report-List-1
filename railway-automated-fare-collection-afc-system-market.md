<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Railway Automated Fare Collection (AFC) System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Farebox</li><li>Ticket Vending Machines (TVM)</li><li>Validator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Railway Automated Fare Collection (AFC) System market consists of three main types: Farebox, Ticket Vending Machines (TVM), and Validators. Farebox is a device used by passengers to insert their fare payment in exchange for a ticket. Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) are automated devices that allow passengers to purchase tickets directly. Validators, on the other hand, validate and store ticket data at the start and end of a journey. These systems help streamline the process of fare collection, making it more efficient and convenient for both passengers and railway operators.</p></p>
