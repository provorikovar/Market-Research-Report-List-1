<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Steel Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion Bonded</li><li>Roll Bonded</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The composite steel plate market includes two major types: explosion bonded and roll bonded. In explosion bonding, two separate metal plates are joined together using high explosive charges, resulting in a solid metallurgical bond. On the other hand, roll bonding involves passing metal plates through high-pressure rollers, creating a strong bond without the use of explosives. Both methods offer unique advantages and are commonly used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and construction for their superior strength, durability, and performance characteristics.</p></p>
