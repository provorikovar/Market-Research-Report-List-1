<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fired Air Heater Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Fired</li><li>Indirect Fired</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Fired Air Heater market encompasses two main types: Direct Fired and Indirect Fired heaters. Direct Fired heaters directly heat the air by burning fuel within the heater, transferring the heat to the air stream. These heaters are commonly used in industrial settings for processes that require direct contact with the heated air. On the other hand, Indirect Fired heaters separate the combustion process from the air stream, preventing any contaminants from entering the heated air. These heaters are often employed in applications where clean, dry air is necessary, such as in construction or agriculture.</p></p>
