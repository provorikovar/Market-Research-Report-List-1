<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Heater Solenoid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting Type</li><li>Internally Piloted Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive heater solenoid valve market consists of two types: direct acting type and internally piloted type. </p><p>The direct acting type solenoid valve operates by directly opening and closing the valve through the electromagnetic force generated by an electric current. This type is commonly used in applications where the required flow rates are low.</p><p>On the other hand, the internally piloted type solenoid valve uses a smaller pilot valve to control the flow of a larger main valve. The pilot valve is operated by the electromagnetic force, which in turn controls the opening and closing of the main valve. This type is suitable for applications requiring higher flow rates.</p></p>
