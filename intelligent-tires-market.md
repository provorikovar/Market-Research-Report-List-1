<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring</li><li>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Intelligent Tires market is divided into two types of monitoring systems: Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring and Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring. Direct Tire Pressure Monitoring involves sensors installed in each tire to directly measure and transmit real-time tire pressure data to the driver. This system offers highly accurate information and alerts the driver in case of low tire pressure. On the other hand, Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring relies on the vehicle's anti-lock braking system to calculate tire pressure based on rotational speed. It provides an estimate of tire pressure but may not be as precise as the direct monitoring system.</p></p>
