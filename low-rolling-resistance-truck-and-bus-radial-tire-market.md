<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low Rolling Resistance Truck and Bus Radial Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Low rolling resistance truck and bus radial tires are designed to minimize energy loss and provide better fuel efficiency. These tires have a unique tread pattern and rubber compounds that reduce friction and heat generation, resulting in lower rolling resistance. Bias tires, on the other hand, have crisscrossed layers of plies that provide a more substantial and stiffer construction. They are more durable but less fuel-efficient. Radial tires, the most common type, have plies that run radially across the tire, offering a flexible sidewall and improved handling and comfort.</p></p>
