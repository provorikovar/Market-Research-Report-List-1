<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Bias Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Bias Tires</li><li>Bias Belted Tire</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The vehicle bias tire market comprises two types: ordinary bias tires and bias belted tires. Ordinary bias tires are constructed with layers of fabric cords interspersed diagonally across the tire, providing strength and durability. They are cost-effective but have lower stability and fuel efficiency. On the other hand, bias belted tires have additional belts made of steel wires, running diagonally under the tread for improved stability and handling. Although more expensive, they offer better performance, longevity, and fuel efficiency.</p></p>
