<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dredge Special Vessels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger</li><li>Cutter-suction Dredge</li><li>Trailing Suction Dredge</li><li>Bucket Dredger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dredge Special Vessels are used for various purposes in the maritime industry. Trailing Suction Hopper Dredgers are versatile vessels equipped with suction pipes to remove sediment from the seabed and store it in their hopper for later disposal. Cutter-suction Dredges use a rotating cutter head to loosen materials before they are suctioned up and pumped. Trailing Suction Dredges also employ suction pipes, but they lack the hopper, so the dredged material is directly pumped ashore. Bucket Dredgers, on the other hand, use a chain of buckets to scoop and transfer sediment from the seabed.</p></p>
