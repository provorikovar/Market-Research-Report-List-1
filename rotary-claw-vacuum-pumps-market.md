<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Claw Vacuum Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-Free Type</li><li>Lubricated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary claw vacuum pumps are commonly categorized into two types: oil-free and lubricated. Oil-free vacuum pumps do not require lubrication and operate by using dry compression to generate vacuum pressure, making them ideal for applications where oil contamination is not desired, such as medical and food processing industries. On the other hand, lubricated vacuum pumps rely on oil to seal and lubricate the internal components, ensuring optimal performance and durability. These pumps are commonly used in industrial settings where high vacuum levels and continuous operation are required.</p></p>
