<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) Receptor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>GABA-A Receptor</li><li>GABA-B Receptor</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) receptor market consists of two types, namely GABA-A receptor and GABA-B receptor. GABA-A receptor is a type of receptor that responds to GABA neurotransmitters, controlling the opening and closing of chloride channels to regulate neuronal activity. On the other hand, GABA-B receptor is a metabotropic receptor, which inhibits neuronal activity via regulating G protein-coupled pathways. Both these receptors play crucial roles in modulating neurotransmission and maintaining brain function, making them important targets for drug development in various neurological disorders.</p></p>
