<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant PPA Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Free Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Flame Retardant PPA market can be divided into two types: Halogen Type and Halogen Free Type. </p><p>Halogen Type refers to flame retardants that contain halogen elements such as chlorine or bromine. These elements contribute to the effective suppression of fire, but they also release toxic gases when burnt. </p><p>On the other hand, Halogen Free Type refers to flame retardants that do not contain halogen elements. They provide a safer alternative as they do not release toxic gases when exposed to fire. Although they may be less effective in fire suppression, their non-toxic nature makes them desirable in certain applications.</p></p>
