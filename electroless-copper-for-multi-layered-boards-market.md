<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electroless Copper for Multi Layered Boards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Electroless Copper</li><li>Vertical Electroless Copper</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Electroless copper is a method used in the production of multi-layered circuit boards. It provides a layer of copper on non-conductive surfaces to create circuit pathways. Horizontal electroless copper refers to the process where the boards are horizontally immersed in the copper solution. This method is preferred for its uniform thickness and lower cost. On the other hand, vertical electroless copper involves the boards being immersed vertically, allowing better control over the copper deposition. This method is suitable for complex and high-density circuit designs. Both types play a crucial role in the multi-layered board manufacturing market.</p></p>
