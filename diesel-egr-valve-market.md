<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel EGR Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pressure</li><li>High Pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Diesel EGR Valve Market consists of two main types: Low Pressure and High Pressure. The Low Pressure EGR Valve functions by recirculating a small portion of exhaust gases back into the engine's intake manifold. This process helps reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. On the other hand, the High Pressure EGR Valve operates by sending exhaust gases, after they have been filtered by a diesel particulate filter, back into the engine. This method aids in reducing particulate matter emissions. Both types play a crucial role in enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing harmful emissions in diesel engines.</p></p>
