<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pre-Crash Seatbelt Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preload Type Belt</li><li>Preroll Preload Type Belt</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pre-crash seatbelts are designed to enhance passenger safety in vehicles by restraining occupants before an impending collision. There are two types of pre-crash seatbelt systems: preload type belts and preroll preload type belts. </p><p>A preload type belt tightens the seatbelt just before a collision, removing any slack and ensuring the occupant is secured tightly against the seat. This rapid tightening helps to reduce the occupant's forward movement during a crash, minimizing the risk of injury. </p><p>In comparison, preroll preload type belts extend the belt slightly before a crash, pulling the occupant deeper into the seat. This action ensures the occupant is better positioned and effectively restrained in preparation for an impact.</p></p>
