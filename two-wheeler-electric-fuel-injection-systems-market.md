<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-Wheeler Electric Fuel Injection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electronic Fuel Injection System</li><li>Carburetted Fuel Injection System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The two-wheeler electric fuel injection systems market includes two main types of systems: electronic fuel injection (EFI) system and carburetted fuel injection system. The EFI system uses electronic controls to precisely meter and deliver fuel to the engine, resulting in improved performance, fuel efficiency, and reduced emissions. On the other hand, the carburetted fuel injection system uses a mechanical carburettor to mix fuel and air before being delivered to the engine, which may result in less precise fuel delivery and lower overall performance compared to EFI systems.</p></p>
