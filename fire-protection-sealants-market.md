<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Protection Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type Sealants</li><li>Intumescent Type Sealants</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Elastomeric type sealants and intumescent type sealants are both types of fire protection sealants used in various industries and applications. Elastomeric sealants are made of elastomers that offer excellent resistance to fire, heat, and smoke. They form a flexible and durable seal that expands and contracts with temperature changes. On the other hand, intumescent sealants are designed to swell and form a protective char when exposed to fire, creating a barrier to prevent the spread of flames and smoke. Both sealant types play a crucial role in fire protection, but each offers unique properties and benefits.</p></p>
